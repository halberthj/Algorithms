# Algorithm Collection

This repository contains a collection of popular algorithms implemented in both C++ and Python. The algorithms are organized by category (e.g. sorting, searching, graph traversal, etc.) and include both the source code and example usage for each algorithm.

## Requirements

- C++11 or later
- Python 3.6 or later

## Getting Started

To use the algorithms in this repository, simply clone the repository and navigate to the directory of the algorithm you want to use.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/halberthj/Algorithms.git
$ cd Algorithms/<algorithm-category>/<language-name>/<algorithm-name>
